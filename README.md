<!-- ANCHOR: catchphrase -->

### a very cool [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) chat homeserver written in Rust

<!-- ANCHOR_END: catchphrase -->

Visit the [conduwuit documentation](https://conduwuit.puppyirl.gay/) for more
information and how to deploy/setup conduwuit.

<!-- ANCHOR: body -->

#### What is Matrix?

[Matrix](https://matrix.org) is an open, federated, and extensible network for
decentralised communication. Users from any Matrix homeserver can chat with users from all
other homeservers over federation. Matrix is designed to be extensible and built on top of.
You can even use bridges such as Matrix Appservices to communicate with users outside of Matrix, like a community on Discord.

#### What is the goal?

A high-performance, efficient, low-cost, and featureful Matrix homeserver that's
easy to set up and just works with minimal configuration needed.

#### Can I try it out?

An official conduwuit server ran by me is available at transfem.dev
([element.transfem.dev](https://element.transfem.dev) /
[cinny.transfem.dev](https://cinny.transfem.dev))

transfem.dev is a public homeserver that can be used, it is not a "test only
homeserver". This means there are rules, so please read the rules:
[https://transfem.dev/homeserver_rules.txt](https://transfem.dev/homeserver_rules.txt)

transfem.dev is also listed at
[servers.joinmatrix.org](https://servers.joinmatrix.org/), which is a list of
popular public Matrix homeservers, including some others that run conduwuit.

#### What is the current status?

conduwuit is technically a hard fork of [Conduit](https://conduit.rs/), which is in beta.
The beta status initially was inherited from Conduit, however the huge amount of
codebase divergance, changes, fixes, and improvements have effectively made this
beta status not entirely applicable to us anymore.

conduwuit is very stable based on our rapidly growing userbase, has lots of features that users
expect, and very usable as a daily driver for small, medium, and upper-end medium sized homeservers.

A lot of critical stability and performance issues have been fixed, and a lot of
necessary groundwork has finished; making this project way better than it was
back in the start at ~early 2024.

#### Where is the differences page?

conduwuit historically had a "differences" page that listed each and every single
different thing about conduwuit from Conduit, as a way to promote and advertise
conduwuit by showing significant amounts of work done. While this was feasible to
maintain back when the project was new in early-2024, this became impossible
very quickly and has unfortunately became heavily outdated, missing tons of things, etc.

It's difficult to list out what we do differently, what are our notable features, etc
when there's so many things and features and bug fixes and performance optimisations, 
the list goes on. We simply recommend folks to just try out conduwuit, or ask us
what features you are looking for and if they're implemented in conduwuit.

#### How is conduwuit funded? Is conduwuit sustainable?

conduwuit has no external funding. This is made possible purely in my freetime with
contributors, also in their free time, and only by user-curated donations.

conduwuit has existed since around November 2023, but [only became more publicly known
in March/April 2024](https://matrix.org/blog/2024/04/26/this-week-in-matrix-2024-04-26/#conduwuit-website)
and we have no plans in stopping or slowing down any time soon!

#### Can I migrate or switch from Conduit?

conduwuit had drop-in migration/replacement support for Conduit for about 12 months before
bugs somewhere along the line broke it. Maintaining this has been difficult and
the majority of Conduit users have already migrated, additionally debugging Conduit
is not one of our interests, and so Conduit migration no longer works. We also
feel that 12 months has been plenty of time for people to seamlessly migrate.

If you are a Conduit user looking to migrate, you will have to wipe and reset
your database. We may fix seamless migration support at some point, but it's not an interest
from us.

#### Can I migrate from Synapse or Dendrite?

Currently there is no known way to seamlessly migrate all user data from the old
homeserver to conduwuit. However it is perfectly acceptable to replace the old
homeserver software with conduwuit using the same server name and there will not
be any issues with federation.

There is an interest in developing a built-in seamless user data migration
method into conduwuit, however there is no concrete ETA or timeline for this.

#### Contact

[`#conduwuit:puppygock.gay`](https://matrix.to/#/#conduwuit:puppygock.gay)
is the official project Matrix room. You can get support here, ask questions or
concerns, get assistance setting up conduwuit, etc.

This room should stay relevant and focused on conduwuit. An offtopic general
chatter room can be found in the room topic there as well.

Please keep the issue trackers focused on *actual* bug reports and enhancement requests.

General support is extremely difficult to be offered over an issue tracker, and
simple questions should be asked directly in an interactive platform like our
Matrix room above as they can turn into a relevant discussion and/or may not be
simple to answer. If you're not sure, just ask in the Matrix room.

If you have a bug or feature to request: [Open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/girlbossceo/conduwuit/issues/new)

If you need to contact the primary maintainer, my contact methods are on my website: https://girlboss.ceo

#### Donate

conduwuit development is purely made possible by myself and contributors. I do
not get paid to work on this, and I work on it in my free time. Donations are
heavily appreciated! ðŸ’œðŸ¥º

- Liberapay: <https://liberapay.com/girlbossceo>
- GitHub Sponsors: <https://github.com/sponsors/girlbossceo>
- Ko-fi: <https://ko-fi.com/puppygock>

I do not and will not accept cryptocurrency donations, including things related.

Note that donations will NOT guarantee you or give you any kind of tangible product,
feature prioritisation, etc. By donating, you are agreeing that conduwuit is NOT
going to provide you any goods or services as part of your donation, and this
donation is purely a generous donation. We will not provide things like paid
personal/direct support, feature request priority, merchandise, etc.

#### Is it conduwuit or Conduwuit?

Both, but I prefer conduwuit.
